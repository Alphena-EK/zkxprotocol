# ZKX Protocol L1 contract and bridge

## Brief

We need to derive an address/key for the L2 smart contract/address.
We can only rely on a piece of information that is (a) private; (b) unique. To get an entry point to generate an elliptic curve, we use a predefined message signed by the user's private key. This prototype is to demonstrate our ability to generate a deterministic entry point.
